## Assume we have a table, index would be timestamp, columns are the first, second, third choices.
## People gonna do the survey first to select top 3 favorite gift. 
## Every gift is unique, so the decision will based on the timestamp of submission.
## Example- A has three choice, gift1, gift6, gift 9;B has three choice, gift1, gift6, gift5. B will select right after A.
## If A selected gift1 before B, and nobody selected gift1 and gift6, then A will get gift1, and B will get gift6.
## If someone selected gift1 before A, and nobody seleted gift6 and gift5, then A gets gift6 and B get gift 5.
## The goal is to find the gift allocation.
